# Liv-Zempel-Vs-Huffman-Encoding-Comparative-Analysis
This python code was written with the objective of comparing performance of Liv Zempel Encoding and Huffman coding for text file compression. By the changing the total size of the file to be compressed, we observe identical asymptotic behavior for both the algorithms.
